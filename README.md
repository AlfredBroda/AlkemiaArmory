Perch-class Heavy Carrier

Remaining frontal turrets have been overhauled to fit a wider variety of armaments. The internal capacitors of the original were replaced with an improved fighter manufactory.

Syreen-class Interceptor

The Syreen represents an effective interceptor unit, capable of taking out whole enemy fighter formations on its own. The main weapon of the Syreen is the Active Close Defense Laser System (ACDLS), a four-lens laser weapon. As well as being an effective ranged armament, it automatically targets enemies close by, providing effective melee defense.
