Lifter-class Cargo Courier

This ship was built out of necessity as Alkemia manufactories had no access to blueprints of ships other than Midline. So their choice of small cargo ships was very slim. To solve this logistical problem the workshops came back with a design based on the readily available Brawler chassis and a few cargo containers.

Dromader-class Dropship

Versatile trans-atmospheric dropship with a moderately sized cargo hold. Features a missile autoforge and a ground support package.

<td>
Roost-class Carrier

A retrofit of the Drover, this destroyer now features a universal medium turret and a rear facing small hybrid turret, as well as a hybrid upgrade to the remaining turrets. This came at the cost of additional fighter capacity, but flare launchers were installed to improve protection.

<td>
Rime-class Racer

When the Alkemia Customs managers were looking for a luxury yacht, the sleek Diable Avionics Rime caught their attention. Unfortunately, it lacked one crucial element - speed. To remedy this, engine systems were replaced and afterburners were installed. This ship is for racing rather than cruising!

<td>
Falcon Cargo-class Armed Freighter

Another repurposed military hull in Alkemia Customs' fleet, the Falcon Cargo was born of necessity. It turned out almost as capable as a Colossus, but signifficantly better armed, despite the necessary removal of some hardpoints. Unsurprisingly, goods deliveries done by Company convoys reached new hights in reliability.

</td>
<td>
Perch-class Heavy Carrier

A retrofit of the Champion, this heavy cruiser trades it's heavy turret and downsizes it's missile slot for three fighter bays. Remaining frontal turrets have been overhauled to fit a wider variety of armaments. The internal capacitors of the original were replaced with an improved fighter manufactory.

</td>
<td>
Conquest-class Battlecruiser

This refit done by Alkemia Customs includes an integrated bay for repair drones. Combat ships get dammaged often and, as few as there are in Company fleet, hauling them to docks everytime would be a waste of valuable time.

<img alt="Consolidation-class" src="https://github.com/AlfredBroda/AlkemiaArmory/blob/master/web/Consolidation.png?raw=true"/>
</td>
<td>
Consolidation-class Battlecruiser

The Consolidation-class is the pinnacle of Alkemia Customs technological knowledge. It integrates one of the largest missile systems found anywhere in the Sector, and retains a lot of the features of the Conquest-class. Repair drone bays were also fitted for on-site repairs making this one of the largest and most expensive mobile repair docks ever built.

<td>
Syreen-class Interceptor

The Syreen represents an effective interceptor unit, capable of taking out whole enemy fighter formations on its own. The main weapon of the Syreen is the Active Close Defense Laser System (ACDLS), a four-lens laser weapon. As well as being an effective ranged armament, it automatically targets enemies close by, providing effective melee defense.
