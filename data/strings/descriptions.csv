alkemia_pilumpod,WEAPON,"A two-stage missile suited for long-range support by backline combat ships. The second stage has a higher top speed, giving it a better chance of defeating point-defense systems.

A technologically mature weapon system, the Pilum-class missile is the obvious choice for long-range strikes by cautious captains. The warhead consists of a device capable of causing spot failures in active shields, and an EMP generator to deliver a modest punch through these gaps. Neither device is particularly effective due to the constraints imposed by the missile's outsized fuel tanks.

A sizable combat-rated autoloader and missile autoforge system ensures continued usefulness in protracted engagements.",,,,
alkemia_vulcan,WEAPON,"A rapid fire weapon that is especially devastating to missiles and fighters at point-blank range. 

This variant uses only a single set of long barrels to limit accuracy loss. A cooldown period prevents detrimental overheating during long bursts.

An advanced timing mechanism beats in the heart of this multi-barrel weapon platform, generally manufactured only by licensed Hegemony Autofactories. Rounds typically use depleted uranium tips and are non explosive. Multiple barrels enable an extremely high rate of fire, which comes at a cost in flux.",,,,
alkemia_locust,WEAPON,"Saturation defense launcher with large numbers of guided low-yeld EMP warheads.

alkemia_acdls,WEAPON,"Fires several bursts in quick succession if allowed to fully recharge. Excellent vs missiles and fighters.

The main weapon of the Syreen is the Active Close Defense Laser System (ACDLS), a four-lens laser weapon. As well as being an effective ranged armament, it automatically targets enemies close by, providing effective melee defense.",,,,
alkemia_rapidhvel,WEAPON,"A specialized weapon designed to overload and disable enemy systems from afar. The high-velocity duranium slug is also effective against shields.

Every engineer feels the need to make things better - with this Rapid Hypervelocity Driver it was the desire to improve on the firing speed. Unfortunately the improved rate of fire comes at the cost of smaller projectiles and high flux.",,,,
alkemia_miningbeam,WEAPON,"A long-range laser design based on the Minig Blaster. 

To get to energy ratings beyond the giga-watt range the design relies on a built-in super capacitor banks. The drain on ship power core is significant, so few designs like the Sunder or Champion can make use of it.

Requiring signifficant time to build up the energy necessary to maintain a coherent beam, the system uses several adjustable lens assemblies to focus the beam on it's target. Ionised particles are accelerated along the beam to hit the target with signifficant kinnetic force.

The extreme range at which targets can be reached is hampered by difficulty to track anything faster then an asteroid.",,,,
alkemia_porcupine_tds,WEAPON,"A long range delivery system for two advanced guided torpedoes.

The premise of the Porcupine Torpedo Delivery System is simple - make torpedoes reach further. Two Atrops warheads were strapped to a frigate sized engine making this a versatile weapon both against larger ships and small craft.",,,,
alkemia_emp_artillery,WEAPON,"A large guided EMP warhead with a very long reach. Designed to disrupt large formations of enemy ships, ths missile can disable a frigate with a glancing hit.

Based on the Domain defense platform ordinance, the AC-EM09b missile delivers a large proximity fused electro magnetic disruptor at extereme distances. Devastating to shields, it's main disadvantage is poor manouverability.",,,,
alkemia_hedgehog,WEAPON,"Launches a cluster of free-floating mines equipped with a proximity fuse.

A Proximity Mine Launcher fires Mark VI fragmentation mines. Unguided and without a propulsion system, they rely on a friend-or-foe targeting system. Their vast numbers allow them to cover a wide swath of space, effectively creating a Point Defense barrier in that location, albeit for a limited time. When the proximity fuse is triggered by an enemy craft, the bomblet will detonate, achieving similar effects to those of flak weapons.",,,,
alkemia_atropos_pod,WEAPON,"An advanced, guided torpedo. The payload is smaller than usual to make room for the advanced guidance package and maneuvering system's reaction mass. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge.",,,,
alkemia_drone_repair,SHIP,A common remote controlled repair drone. Useful for armour repairs even during battle.,,,,
alkemia_deluxe,SHIP,"A highly customizable two seat heavy fighter boasting two hybrid and two reconfigurable missile hardpoints, plus an afterburner.",,,,

alkemia_roost,SHIP,"A retrofit of the Drover, this destroyer now features a universal medium turret and a rear facing small hybrid turret, as well as a hybrid upgrade to the remaining turrets. This came at the cost of additional fighter capacity, but flare launchers were installed to improve protection.",,,,
alkemia_buzzard,SHIP,"A dedicated missile destroyer based on the Hammerhead. Boasting an impressive ordinance store and rapid autoloaders, the Buzzard can deal a staggering amount of damage for it's size.",,,,
alkemia_perch,SHIP,"A refit of the Champion, this heavy cruiser trades it's heavy turret and downsizes it's missile slot for three fighter bays. Remaining frontal turrets have been overhauled to fit a wider variety of armaments. The internal capacitors of the original were replaced with an improved fighter manufactory.

This is one of Alkemia Customs' flagship products.",,,,
alkemia_rime_racer,SHIP,"When the Alkemia Customs managers were looking for a luxury yacht, the sleek Diable Avionics Rime caught their attention. Unfortunately, it lacked one crucial element - speed. To remedy this, engine systems were replaced and afterburners were installed. This ship is for racing rather than cruising!",,,,
alkemia_shepherd,SHIP,"A refit of the classic Ko Combine r450 focusing on actual military use. The integrated wing was replaced with Repair Drones and all systems were upgraded according to modern military standards. This unfortunately necessitated the removal of Salvage Equipment. 

This is one of Alkemia Customs' flagship products.",,,,
alkemia_lifter,SHIP,This ship was built out of necessity as Alkemia manufactories had no access to blueprints of ships other than Midline. So their choice of small cargo ships was very slim. To solve this logistical problem the workshops came back with a design based on the readily available Brawler chassis and a few cargo containers.,,,,
alkemia_falcon_cargo,SHIP,"Another repurposed military hull in Alkemia Customs's fleet, the Falcon Cargo was born of necessity. It turned out almost as capable as a Colossus, but signifficantly better armed, despite the necessary removal of some hardpoints. Unsurprisingly, goods deliveries done by Company convoys reached new hights in reliability.",,,,
alkemia_hammer_tanker,SHIP,"Like with the Falcon Cargo, Alkemia Customs had an abundace of millitary designs, but few logistics vessels. This was an attempt to fit prometheum tanks on the Hammerhead destroyer chassis. Many Comapny captains will voice their approval for the level of protection this vessel gives them.",,,,
alkemia_consolidation,SHIP,"The Consolidation-class is the pinnacle of Alkemia Customs technological knowledge. It integrates one of the largest missile systems found anywhere in the Sector, and retains a lot of the features of the Conquest-class. Repair drone bays were also fitted for on-site repairs.",,,,
alkemia_rigger,SHIP,"The Rigger in one of the largest and most expensive mobile repair docks ever built, rivaled only by Roider Argo-class. It features numerous repair, salvage and production facilities, massive part stores and, last but not least, two drone hangars. All that makes it capable of salvaging and refitting all but the largest vessels.

The Rigger's hull is modular, each of it's prows equipped with independent shield emmiters, defense systems and fire control. Furthermore the loss of one prow does not compromise the ship as a whole, altough it is still undoubtedly crippled.",,,,
alkemia_kestrel,SHIP,"The Kestrel is the essence of Techie design ideology. It is fast - even without it's afterburner - has an array of varied weapon mounts, and packs a punch with an integrated Atropos torpedo launcher. It was also designed with stealth in mind, with an integrated ECM suite and low profile engine exhausts.",,,,
alkemia_coockoo,SHIP,"Another refit of the classic Ko Combine r450 completely repurposing it's interior space - most of it now housing a proximity mine nanoforge. The now purposeless drone landing pad was replaced with a secondary defense turret, and the front part houses a high-resolution sensor array indispensible in it's new line of duty.",,,,
alkemia_pheasant,SHIP,"Created with the synergy of the ER Mining Laser and Sunder power core in mind, the Pheasant is a dedicated mining ship. Able to break even large asteroids into smaller chunks from a safe distance, it relies on it's drones to perform the actual mineral extraction.
