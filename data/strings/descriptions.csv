alkemia_pilumpod,WEAPON,"A two-stage missile suited for long-range support by backline combat ships. The second stage has a higher top speed, giving it a better chance of defeating point-defense systems.

A technologically mature weapon system, the Pilum-class missile is the obvious choice for long-range strikes by cautious captains. The warhead consists of a device capable of causing spot failures in active shields, and an EMP generator to deliver a modest punch through these gaps.
