alkemia_pilumpod,WEAPON,"A two-stage missile suited for long-range support by backline combat ships. The second stage has a higher top speed, giving it a better chance of defeating point-defense systems.

A technologically mature weapon system, the Pilum-class missile is the obvious choice for long-range strikes by cautious captains. The warhead consists of a device capable of causing spot failures in active shields, and an EMP generator to deliver a modest punch through these gaps. Neither device is particularly effective due to the constraints imposed by the missile's outsized fuel tanks.

A sizable combat-rated autoloader and missile autoforge system ensures continued usefulness in protracted engagements.",,,
alkemia_vulcan,WEAPON,"A rapid fire weapon that is especially devastating to missiles and fighters at point-blank range. 

This variant uses only a single set of long barrels to limit accuracy loss. A cooldown period prevents detrimental overheating during long bursts.

An advanced timing mechanism beats in the heart of this multi-barrel weapon platform, generally manufactured only by licensed Hegemony Autofactories. Rounds typically use depleted uranium tips and are non explosive. Multiple barrels enable an extremely high rate of fire, which comes at a cost in flux.",,,,
alkemia_locust,WEAPON,"Saturation defense launcher with large numbers of guided low-yeld EMP warheads.

alkemia_acdls,WEAPON,"The main weapon of the Syreen is the Active Close Defense Laser System (ACDLS), a four-lens laser weapon. As well as being an effective ranged armament, it automatically targets enemies close by, providing effective melee defense.",,,
alkemia_rapidhvel,WEAPON,"Every engineer feels the need to make things better - with this Rapid Hypervelocity Driver it was the desire to improve on the firing speed. Unfortunately the improved rate of fire comes at the cost of smaller projectiles and high flux.",,,
alkemia_porcupine_tds,WEAPON,"The premise of the Porcupine Torpedo Delivery System is simple - make torpedoes reach further. Four Atrops warheads were strapped to this frigate sized engine making this a versatile weapon both against larger ships and small craft.",,,
alkemia_emp_artillery,WEAPON,"Based on the Domain defense platform ordinance, the AC-EM09b missile delivers a large proximity fused electro magnetic disruptor at extereme distances. Devastating to shields, it's main disadvantage is poor manouverability.",,,
alkemia_drone_repair,SHIP,"A common remote controlled repair drone.",,,
alkemia_deluxe,SHIP,"A highly customizable two seat heavy fighter boasting two hybrid and two reconfigurable missile hardpoints, plus an afterburner.",,,
alkemia_syreen,SHIP,"The Syreen represents an effective interceptor unit, capable of taking out whole enemy fighter formations on its own.",,,
alkemia_dromader,SHIP,"Versatile trans-atmospheric dropship with a moderately sized cargo hold. Features a missile autoforge and a ground support package.",,,
alkemia_roost,SHIP,"A retrofit of the Drover, this destroyer now features a universal medium turret and a rear facing small hybrid turret, as well as a hybrid upgrade to the remaining turrets. This came at the cost of additional fighter capacity, but flare launchers were installed to improve protection.",,,
alkemia_buzzard,SHIP,"A dedicated missile destroyer based on the Hammerhead. Boasting an impressive ordinance store and rapid autoloaders, the Buzzard can deal a staggering ammount of damage for it's size.",,,
alkemia_perch,SHIP,"A refit of the Champion, this heavy cruiser trades it's heavy turret and downsizes it's missile slot for three fighter bays. Remaining frontal turrets have been overhauled to fit a wider variety of armaments. The internal capacitors of the original were replaced with an improved fighter manufactory.

This is one of Alkemia Customs' flagship products.",,,
alkemia_rime_racer,SHIP,"When the Alkemia Customs managers were looking for a luxury yacht, the sleek Diable Avionics Rime caught their attention. Unfortunately, it lacked one crucial element - speed. To remedy this, engine systems were replaced and afterburners were installed. This ship is for racing rather than cruising!",,,
alkemia_shepherd,SHIP,"A refit of the classic Ko Combine r450 focusing on actual military use. The integrated wing was replaced with Repair Drones and all systems were upgraded according to modern military standards. This unfortunately necessitated the removal of Surveying Equipment. 

This is one of Alkemia Customs' flagship products.",,,
alkemia_lifter,SHIP,"This ship was built out of necessity as Alkemia manufactories had no access to blueprints of ships other than Midline. So their choice of small cargo ships was very slim. To solve this logistical problem the workshops came back with a design based on the readily available Brawler chassis and a few cargo containers.",,,
alkemia_falcon_cargo,SHIP,"Another repurposed military hull in Alkemia Customs's fleet, the Falcon Cargo was born of necessity. It turned out almost as capable as a Colossus, but signifficantly better armed, despite the necessary removal of some hardpoints. Unsurprisingly, goods deliveries done by Company convoys reached new hights in reliability.",,,
alkemia_hammer_tanker,SHIP,"Like with the Falcon Cargo, Alkemia Customs had an abundace of millitary designs, but few logistics vessels. This was an attempt to fit prometheum tanks on the Hammerhead destroyer chassis. Many Comapny captains will voice their approval for the level of protection this vessel gives them.",,,
alkemia_consolidation,SHIP,"The Consolidation-class is the pinnacle of Alkemia Customs technological knowledge. It integrates one of the largest missile systems found anywhere in the Sector, and retains a lot of the features of the Conquest-class. Repair drone bays were also fitted for on-site repairs.",,,
alkemia_rigger,SHIP,"The Rigger in one of the largest and most expensive mobile repair docks ever built, rivaled only by Roider Argo-class. It features numerous repair, salvage and production facilities, massive part stores and, last but not least, two drone hangars. All that makes it capable of salvaging and refitting all but the largest vessels.",,,
alkemia_afterburner,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Temporarily engages an afterburner on the ship. Provides a massive speed boost at the expense of weapons and manouverability. The ship runs the risk of full engine flameout on any significant collision.",Movement,"Provides a massive speed boost for at the expense of weapons and manouverability. Collisions can cause a flameout while the system is active.",,
alkemia_emp,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates an EMP generator. Nearby missiles, fighters, weapon emplacements and engines of enemy ships are all targeted and can be disabled in short order.

Unfortunately, on-board weapon systems must be shut down to provide power for this device. The EMP pulses are also not very effective against enemy shields.",Special,"Generates lightning arcs that quickly knock out enemy missiles, weapons, and engines within range. Mostly negated by shields.",,
