# NOTES
# Ship IDs entered here will be allowed for duplication.
# "This feature is very hard to get working in campaign as a player, and lorewise, allows for duplication of even the most complex hulls."

# Specials - these are optional. They could go away if people complain about them being available. If you think they shouldn't be available, remove them.
